# Unknown Author Profile

This is a placeholder profile used when no specific author profile file is found.

If you are seeing this profile being used, create a specific profile file for the author:

1. Create a file named `[author-name].md` in `packages/sales-enablement/profiles/`
2. Replace spaces in author name with dots and convert to lowercase
3. Example: "Jane Smith" → `jane.smith.md`
4. Copy the YAML frontmatter structure from `tom.cranstoun.md` and populate with author-specific information
