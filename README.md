# MX-Gathering: Community Resources and Thought Leadership

**An open-source collaborative space for building community, sharing resources, and advancing thought leadership around Machine Experience (MX) patterns, AI agent interactions, and the convergence of automated and human user experiences.**

## What is Machine Experience (MX)?

Machine Experience examines how AI agents interact with digital interfaces and proposes design patterns that benefit both automated systems and human users through the **Convergence Principle** - interfaces optimised for AI agents inherently improve accessibility and usability for everyone.

## Repository Purpose

This community repository provides:

- **Event Organization** - Templates and resources for hosting meetups, workshops, and conferences
- **Discussion Archives** - Preserved conversations about implementation patterns, metadata strategies, and industry developments
- **Shared LLM Prompts** - Reusable prompts for content generation, analysis, and optimization
- **Metadata Standards** - Discussions and proposals for structured data, Schema.org patterns, and AI discoverability
- **Thought Leadership** - Position papers, analysis, and commentary on the evolving AI agent ecosystem
- **Community Guidelines** - How to contribute, code of conduct, and recognition

## Web Presence

MX-Gathering is accessible through multiple domains:

- **[mx-thegathering.ai](https://mx-thegathering.ai)** - Primary community hub (coming soon)
- **[mx-thegathering.net](https://mx-thegathering.net)** - Technical documentation
